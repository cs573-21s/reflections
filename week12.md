This paper provides information about what data is displayed on smartwatches and how. The authors surveyed 237 smartwatch users to learn more about the representations on smartwatch faces. They found that the watches predominantly show information about health and fitness, and icons with text is the most frequent type of representation. These results tell us how we can format further visualizations for watch faces, as well as what data may be the most relevant to users.

The figure above shows the most common data types people choose to show on their watches. People configure their watches to show a median of 5 different things, with the top three being battery level, outside temperature, and step count. Other than device information, users primarily display health information as well as weather. This tells us the main utility of smartwatches for most individuals is personal health, and allows us to understand what further visualizations may be helpful. A watch screen is extremely small and condensed, so there is only enough space for the most crucial information, displayed as simply as possible.

I thought Figure 7 (above) was particularly interesting because it shows a comparison between what the watch is actually able to track versus what users actually see on their watch face. There are many miscellaneous options that are just not seen by most people, such as wind speed/direction. The most important information, as shown by what users see the most, once again appeared to be temperature/weather information, as well as steps and some other health information.
