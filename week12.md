The publication describes that overlaying data on graph vertices, one value at a time can lead to faster performance for tasks involving analysis of a graph that involves time series data. By looking at the vertices and deciding whether to use multiple, or singular datapoints there comes an effect on their said oucome. Its usually an effect that promotes more clarity in the graphs visualizaiton according to this group.

## Initial Response
I thought it was interesting that the number of nodes at a vertex could directly effect the ability for an individual to perceive data. To me, I wonder if there is a difference between overwhelming the user and visually adding more actions to the vertecies. Overlaying, data on a graph in this fashion is interesting because it does appear that it would not be as efficeint in visual search. I would think that this would be visually distracting, but in many cases, according to this study it was faster and more accurate.

## Takeaways

I think my biggest takeaway is the impact of user testing in this study. I think my initial thoughts are to not judge a book by its cover, but in this case there was insights that were presented to bring forth the not expected outcome. Single vs. Multiple attributes also seemed to have different levels of accuray but the more nodes represented the easier it was for the eyes.
