The Covid anniversary is approaching us, and we're around that time where we can look at some of these interesting visualizations that were developed over the past year or so.

## Initial Response

Initially when seeing this visualization, the first thought that came to my mind, was that timelapses really can tell you a multidimensional story. I really enjoy the how multidimensional they are and I feel as if you have way more control in adjusting the narrative. This can be a good thing, but it can also be a bad thing. Controlling the narative can introduce bias but I didn't think that this was the case with this time lapse. It was interesting to see where the first couple cases came up and so forth. It does get a little weird as there are several datapoints, but the story is told none the less. One thing that I did find challenging was that I couldn't help but continually try to remember where I was at certain parts of the year. The date was like half a distraction to me. I do think that that may simply be specific to me though.

## Takeaways

I thought that with time lapses the future is for sure bright here for data science. I can't speak for all people, but I know for myself, atleast, I am almost always able to get a bigger picture if there is a narrative that comes along with it. I thought it was great that I could follow the bigger picture story progressively. Theres even more interesting things that you can do with seasons, based on the date that wasn't added here, but I do think that would be a nice additional feature.
