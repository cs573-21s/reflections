This vis shows a creative representation of the Olympic Synchronized Diving scores. There are two events: the 3. springboard and the 10m platform diving events. For each of these events, and for both men and women, the vis shows the scores of the silver, gold, and bronze medalist countries. The height and the width of the swirls show different aspect of the score, so it cleverly encodes a lot of information that is all easily visible at first glance. 

There are many design aspects of this vis that are very effective and beatiful. The gold, silver, and bronze medalist countries are arranged in the order silver-gold-bronze, as they would be on the Olympic podium. This makes sense and also creates more symmetry, since the gold is higer than the other two scores. 

Stacking the scores on top of each other makes this vis a bit like a stacked bar chart (with much more creative design). On a basic level of conveying the relative scores, this is a very effective way to display this information because it is easy to compare the total scores of each country, as well adn the scores of each of the 5 (women's) or 6 (mens') rounds. 

The vis also gives more information about each score on mouse over. This is effective bceause there is too much information to have it all on the graph at once. However, it is slightly hard to read the text because it is small serif font over the colorful, intricate swirls. It would be easier to read if it used a different font (larger or more bold, for example) so the text stood out more, or if the colorful swirls were greyed out slightly in the background so the text would stand out more. However, this is more effective as it is done when you click on a particular round. Then, all the other rounds are greyed out, and the vis focuses on just the round selected, so it is easy to compare the competitors for just that round. This is very clear and intuitive functionality, and also an effective way to help the viewwer compare some of the information more specifically and with more detail, since the entire vis has too much information to easily compare in great detail at once for the average viewer. 

One aspect of this vis that is comfusing is whether the colors have significance. It is not clear to me, and is not explained as far as I can see, whether the colors have some meaning of if they are just different colors to distinguish the different countries. The colors make it beautiful, but it might be even better if they also encoded some information, such as corresponding to the country's flag colors, or the color of the medal.
