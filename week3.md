I chose a visualization from the New York Times for this week's reflection. It's a dynamic visualization that shows the COVID-19 vaccine rollout across the United States. This is a visualization that changes weekly and I like to check it pretty often as a gauge to see how soon life can get back to normal or the way it was "pre-COVID". The New York Times has a lot of good visualizations that I've definitely used as a resource to find more information quickly. 

The visualization itself offers a lot of information from first glance. The gradient of colors on the map displays how far each state has gotten with it's vaccine rollout. The map is also interactive and offers more precise information about each state as you hover over the state with your mouse. I also like this page as a whole because of the different visualizations as you scroll down because it answers a lot of FAQs. For example there's a bar chart showing new reported doses per day in the United States and another chart showing how long it will take to get a given percentage of the US population vaccinated at the current pace of vaccinations.
