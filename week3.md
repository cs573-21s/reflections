I am interested in agriculture and focusing on visualizations related to agriculture. This link shows some visualizations related to a research program on agroforestry for conservation and restoration in Barbados. This is a cool project where a sand quarry was converted in to a permaculture reserve. Quantitative verification is needed to further support and expand adoption of regenerative agriculture practices. The images also relate to the reading this week on colormaps. 

The first image shows carbon sequestration and uses a sequential colormap for ordered data. I think it's using luminance for increasing values of carbon sequestration. Below and to the left, hue is used for categorical data for land classification. Figure 3 doesn't have a key but it looks like it is using a diverging colormap where the yellow is neutral, increasing saturation of green indicates regeneration, increasing saturation of red indicates degradation. Together this data will give a picture over time of how different practices contribute to land restoration and ecosystem health.
