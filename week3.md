Category: Exploring approaches to effectively visualizing temporal data

One of the aspects of dataviz that I am interested in exploring is the visualization of temporal data that represents user action to help the user understand and gain insight in a more effective manner. This viz allows the exploration of data both in numerical order of the Codex Atlanticus and the chronological representation of when they were worked on. I particularly like the chronological ordering as it facilitates tracking Da Vinci's work across time and ordering events chronologically is often the best way to memorize major events. 

This visualization also explores how leveraging a combination of multiple visualization can often be more effective at representing the data and communicating significance of the information in a more digestible manner. If you want to look at when sections of the Codex were written then you can select active pages and the timeperiod you are interested in. This allows the user insights into what were the problems da Vinci was interested in during that time. This also helps us figure out how da Vinci might have come up with solutions in one domain based on his knowledge and work in a different domain for example his progress in Architecture during a particular period could easily be influenced by the work he was doing in Geometry, Physics and tools and machines. The legend of the subjects also makes it conveinet to track the focus of the work he published.
