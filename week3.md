This visualization from r/dataisbeautiful on Reddit shows the spread of COVID-19 in the United States from March to July 2020. It uses a map to show districts that have COVID, and uses colors to demonstrate how many cases are at each location. For low amounts of cases, the graphic uses a deep blue, and there is a rainbow scale, with an extremely high amount of cases (>1000 per 100K) being dark red. Because it progressively shows each day, the viewer can tell where outbreaks start early on, and make inferences about what might have happened. For example, a majority of Massachusetts has been deep red from early on, which is likely related to the outbreak that occurred at at a large conference here. It also shows how exponential the spread is, as it starts slowly in some far-apart locations and then speads nationwide and gets much worse in a very short span of time. By July, the outbreak is clearly much worse in cities and the east coast.

Visually, the graphic is extremely easy to understand, with white outlines for the state borders and a very big color difference between low and high cases. It switches quickly between the days so you can view the overall trend at a glance, while still being slow enough that one can pause at a specific day if they want to focus on it. Although it is not a complex visualization, it clearly portrays the data it wants to show in an easy-to-understand way.
