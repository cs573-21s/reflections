This visualization shows the current progress on vaccinating people around the world. It uses percentage out of total country population as a gauge, but also includes the actual population next to the country name as a reference. You can use the Play button to see the progress animated day-to-day or you can select a specific date to see that day's data. There are also options to select specific countries, specific continents, and whether to compare using only one dose or a complete vaccination.

I think this visualization does a great job of being extremely clear while also being visually appealing. Each country's vaccination data is represented by a needle that is being filled based on the percent vaccinated. A needle is a good choice for a bar chart because it already has tick marks and the bar naturally sits within the barrel. The color of the bar in the needle represents a continent, making it more clear which general areas seem to be getting vaccinated faster. The needle tip serves as an underline for the country name, flag, and population. 

In general, the visualization gets the data across to the viewer very efficiently. Additionally, the interactive elements allow the user to find out more about certain locations or periods of time. It is updated everyday so it will be interesting to see how each country will progress in the future.
