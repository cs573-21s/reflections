Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe Ridgeline

This is a ridgeline visual I found from /r/dataisbeautiful showing the distribution of different ingredients in cakes. Ridgeline visuals compare the distributions of several groups against each other. In this case, the distribution of the percent contribution of each ingredient to a specific recipe is shown. For instance, Flour (top of the viz) shows up around 30% of the time on average. The interquartile ranges (I'm guessing that's what this is) are also shown for each ingredient as vertical lines along the distribution. The count and a labels are also shown on the left side of each ingredient line.

The x-axis is somewhat logorithmic. The specific equation that is used to calculate the percentage weighting is not shown. The verticle lines help to show where each of the ingredients falls.

Some ingredients are shown to have multiple distributions. For instance, water has two distinct peaks. Ingredients that show up in above 100 recipes are colored brown. This highlighting helps show which ingredients are more representitive. Related to this, none of the brown color-labeled ingredients have multiple peaks, which may suggest that their relative role in each of the recipes ends up falling into a particular bucket. For instance, despite chocolate having a very high spread in these recipes, there is one distinct peak. Now, this doesn't mean that the mean is the best. It could be that as you increase the amount of chocolate, you can alter the amount of other ingredients to compensate, and somewhere along this increase, you can find a better or the best recipe. I find it interesting though that this happens in a relatively smooth fashion. This might be an artifact of interpolation of the implementation of the visual representation of the distribution. Or this could be because once factoring in people's preferences and tradition (not opting to try more or less chocolate), you simply just end up with a distribution of the differen't things people have tried.

It would be interesting to see how the different peaks in some of the ingredients are explained; for instance, one suggestion to make this graphic interactive is to allow the user to select a sub range of one of the ingredient usages and then see how the relative distributions of the other ingredients changes. For instance, if we select the lower range of chocolate, we might see less sugar to make up for the bitterness of the chocolate (if it wasn't milk chocolate). This would also help to explain what the distributions actually correspond to of multiple possible interpretations.

Along these same lines, subtyping the different kinds of chocolate might be interesting. These kinds of graphs might offer heuristics that help in figuring out how to adapt to new recipe requests. For instance, if someone wants less chocolate, maybe they should increase the amount of vanilla. If someone doesn't want to use water in their recipe, then maybe there's a certian type of milk that would work best. A lot of cooking is about optimization, and I think that there is a lot of interesting applications of a graphic like this towards optimizing or coming up with new recipes. This idea is related to the fuzzy logic concept which a lot of japanese products take advantage of; the idea is to partition the set of outputs with some sort of labeling schema. A simple example is coding a rice cooker towards hot, warm, room temperature, cool, and cold, and then assigning different cooling algorithms in respective dependence. https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/fuzzyjapan.htm
