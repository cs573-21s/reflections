I have given up on finding visualizations related to agriculture. But if I come across any in my day to day I will use them. I came across a data visualization blog and one of the first examples was related to number of unique words used by hip-hop artists. I am a fan of hip-hop music and I found this interesting. In the first visual you can see each artist's face and mousing over shows their unique words and changes the mark border. There is also a drop down to search for a specific artist. There's also a toggle for just WuTang (ODB didn't make the list). The next visualization has the artist names still in order by unique words used and now color coded for their era. That is interesting to see trends. The third visualization compares hip hop to other genres of music and shows there are a lot more unique words in hip hop. I enjoy hip hop lyrics and their uniqueness and current event relevance shows in these visualizations. The author used the rapper's first 35,000 lyrics for artists who have been rapping for a while. I would have chosen their most recent 35,000 lyrics. Or evaluated the difference at least.
