### Summary
This week I watched a [video by EagerEyes](https://eagereyes.org/blog/2019/eagereyestv-episode-2-unit-charts-dot-plots-and-isotype-and-what-makes-them-special#more-12392) about breaking up a bar chart into units and what effect that has on a viewer's ability to understand the chart. He found that breaking a bar chart into unit images made the charts more memorable and easier to understand because the data can rely on the brain's subconscious system to count small groups of objects. These charts can be even more memorable if the unit representations are icons representing what they are counting rather than just dots or other more neutral symbols. This effect loses its usefulness for large groups of objects.

### Analysis
This effect is really interesting to me, and it makes a lot of intuitive sense. It's much more memorable to see four and a half cows than to see a labeled graph with a colored bar. I hadn't really thought about how much I would struggle to recall what a given data visualization actually looks like beyond a qualitative description. It's interesting that breaking a graph into unit icons can draw focus toward the actual values a visual seeks to convey.

I'm really interested to see how else this could be applied to make graphs more memorable. I'm curious if breaking a pie chart into ten separated pieces could make it more readable. I'm curious if there are ways to break more complex, modern visualizations (like area-based box diagrams) into a few memorable components to highlight.
