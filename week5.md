## Initial Response

My initial thoughts in regards to this visualization were that it was pretty powerful that we could take something as confusing as a symphony performed by an orchestra and compress it to one minimal form factor. When I initially took this class, I had it in the back of my mind that I wanted to see the relationship between the arts (music in this example) and data vis. This vis, did a good job of representing amplitude in this way. I felt that I could understand the roles of different instrumentations immediately just by looking at the vis. This vis does a great job of using color as well. As someone who's color blind the colors were not too distracting or too overbearing. Even though I couldn't understand the language by simply looking at the iconography and amplitudes of the sound waves. I could immediately tell that a story was being told.

## Takeaways

One of my takeaways from this visualization was that it made great use of the gestalts principles of design. For me, these principles were very apparent. An example of this is the principle of proximity. When you look at the placement of elements within the vis, I immediately could testify that there was a pleasing form of cohesiveness.
