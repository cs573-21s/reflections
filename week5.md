If you've ever watched Dragon Ball Z, you know there are a **lot** of fights thoughout the whole series. The visualization shows every fight that happens and between who. You can see the story progression and also follow along a character through the paths and arcs indicated. Each circle represents a character and the different story arcs are indented. The main characters get their iconic color such as Goku gets orange from his shirt. If the character ever goes into a more powerful form during their fight, it's indicated through outer strokes. When you hover over a specific fight, the visual has an animation and provides more information such as the charcters involved, if they were in a specifial form, and some background information on the fight. You can also hover over specific arcs to follow a specific character's fights. For the characters fighting for good, their arcs were on the left side of the line and the characters fighting for evil had their arcs on the right side. The visual as a whole is really cool to look through and has a lot of information. For more fun and extra interactions, there are bubbles with images. It adds to the visual aesthetic and when clicked, takes you to a clip of that particular fight.
