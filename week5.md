Category: Leveraging a combination of charts to represent click-stream data more effectively.

The data viz explores enhancing the interpretability of the information hidden within a complex click-stream data where you leverage the benefits of multiple charts. Click-stream data is rather difficult to visualize in general when you want to represent granular data in real-time for people to extract actionable information. The combination of the four charts was particularly interesting as they helped address various questions that a person analyzing the data might want answered. You can find the outliers, patterns or interesting clusters using the directed graph. This can be utilized to analyze individuals using the sunburst or Sankey charts. The horizontal barchart can be used to compare individuals or compare individual against aggregate data.
The cons of this visualization approach are that people analyzing the data cannot take instantaneous actions as it takes a while to analyze the data and draw conclusions, there is also an inherent expectations that people reading the charts would know how to read the charts.
