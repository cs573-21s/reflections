This visualization is an Alluvial diagram that shows the economic classes in Germany over four years. The visualization has several good qualities, but the data being used is not appropriate and does not support the conclusions presented. 

The Alluvial diagram is a great choice of chart type for to display data about changes in economic status. It clearly shows what proportion of each economic group ended up in each other group. One potential flaw is that the economic groups are represented categorically, which is a simplification - there is a range of income levels within each of these bins. However, this simplification makes the chart very easy to read and understand. 

This chart also has some helpful design elements. The parts of the diagram originating in classes other than "poor" are greyed out, which makes it much easier to focus on the people either escaping or remaining in poverty since that is the question at hand. The choice to grey these parts out rather than to completely remove them also means that if the viewer gets curious, they can try to compare the poor group's mobility to the other groups'. It also means that the data is not presented in an incomplete manner. 

The dots flowing from one side of the diagram to the other are also helpful. They emphasize the point that the Alluvial diagram shows mobility between different groups over time, or changes in a network. The dots travelling at different speeds serves to make it more visually interesting.

The main problem with this visualization is that the data behind it only comes from a span of 4 years. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this, it would be more relevant to show the changes in economic status over a longer time period than 4 years because one does not expect a huge amount of mobility in income levels in such a short period. The title of the post, "Who's born poor, stays poor, in Germany, study finds," is too strong a conclusion to draw from this data.
