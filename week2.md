I looked at a visual posted on Reddit (/r/dataisbeautiful) that was from the National Weather Service. The visualization shows a map of Texas and the surrounding states with the corresponding temperatures for each region as a large snow storm moves through.  I think it was interesting to see such low temperatures in the south. The visualization is dynamic and displays a cold front hitting the states as the temperature drops. It was really cool that the visualization was dynamic because it displayed the movement of the storm very well.

The caption for the visualization was "Cold plunge triggers electricity price hike" which I thought would have fit better had the animation also involved some sort of visual for the electricity price to correspond to the cold temperatures.
