This visualization from r/dataisbeautiful on Reddit shows the top commented subreddits for the last two years. It goes through each day, ranking the top subreddits and using bars to portray the amount of comments in each one. Despite how quickly it cycles through each day, it is still pretty clear from a glance which subreddits stay consistently at the top of the charts. However, to me it is even more interesting to be able to look at the timing of certain trends. In this way, the viewer can reflect on what happened in the world to cause drastic changes. For example, r/wallstreetbets, along with similar subreddits, surged recently and topped the charts as a result of the recent short squeeze with Gamestop and AMC. Additionally, the graphic shows a major news headline for every single day. From this, we can deduce information such as that r/politics gained popularity on election day, without outside knowledge. If the user so chooses, they can pause the video at any time to see the data for any specific day, and not only learn about the most active subreddits, but also recall an important piece of news from that day. 

The visualization does a great job of displaying the information in a way that is easily readable. Each bar representing a subreddit is a completely different color, and the font is readable at a glance. The backdrop is black, and the specific numbers representing the comments on each subreddit per day are a dark gray so they do not distract from the more important information (the bars). The transitions between each day are smooth so that one is able to properly read the bars even as they transition. In general, I think this is a very well thought-out representation that shows what people on Reddit are talking about throughout the last two years.
