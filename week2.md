This visualization was featured on Tableau Public, and I thought it was really cool especially for Black History Month. For this reflection,
I will be doing the same exercise that we did this past Thursday's lab to break down this visualization. 

For the "what", this visual uses items as data types, specifically different "first" events in history that led to widespread cultural change by black men and women in America.
While it may look like a series of lists, I would consider this a table because it does cateogrize the different events by the sector of the breakthrough. The dataset is also static.
In terms of attributes, the items are organized by categories, and are ordered sequentially from earlies event at the top, to most recent at the bottom.

For the "why", the visual is used to consume information, specifically to present these breakthroughs. The audience would be mostly exploring the information because they probably do
not have a taget in mind nor a location. In terms of query, it is used to identify. For the targets, the visual features the different events.

Finally, for the "how", the use of color is effective to distiguish between the breakthroughs made by black men and women. It is also interactive and allows you to select a specific 
circle, which embedded in it is the year, the name of the person, and the event. 

Overall, I think it is a very nicely designed visualization. The color scheme ties into the subject at hand, and the use images fills up the rest of he space well. In the upper text,
"men" and "women" are highlighed to indicate their corresponding circles, which I thought was a pretty subtle yet nice way to create a key. Also, by ordering the different sectors so
the number of achievements increase, it almost creates a diagnol to the image, which makes it very dynamic to look at. Going off that, because it increases, it kind of reminds you
of how much Black Americans have contributed, especially in the arts and entertainment sector.
