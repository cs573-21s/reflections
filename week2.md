One thing that I have noticed that can be very important in visual design is the use of color. This may seem obvious, but in most cases people use color for purely aesthetic or hierarchical representations. Being someone who is color blind, the use of color in most graphs is pretty trash, in my opionion. On a decent amount of visualizations, I never seem to truly understand why the colors were of any significance. In this example, the use of color is definitely very important and accessibility is accounted for in a very wise manner.

## Initial Response

Initially when seeing this visualization, my first thought that came to mind, was that the use of gradients was actually very effective in pointing my eyes in the right direction. Especially when seeking a region with higher pay versus one with lower pay. Another observation I definitely made was that places with big cities were probably more in tune to have an average police salary that was on the higher side. One great thing about this visualization that I noticed was the positioning of state nodes. They were pretty much in the same position they usually would be. That made it very easy to traverse the items. I already had a key-value map of the United States stored subconciously. One that I was already familiar with.

## Takeaways

Is there much data visualization can do in terms of accessibility? I feel like in computer science, with web development and mobile development, accessibility is a big part of the workflow. It is very important to make good use of font sizes, colors, and tools that can be widely adopted across your audience.
