This week, I read a [blog post by Eager Eyes](https://eagereyes.org/blog/2020/eagereyestv-chart-appreciation-whats-really-warming-the-world) about a visualization that Bloomberg Business Week created to explore the different potential contributions to climate change. The purpose of the visual is to demonstrate to the reader that the primary factor in climate change is greenhouse gas emissions. What makes the visual particularly interesting is that rather than presenting the user with a single static or dynamic chart, the page walks the user through a narrative that the data helps illustrate. The user needs to scroll to activate the next part of the story. Eager Eyes points out how this structure helps build narrative tension by repeating what isn't causing climate change, which leaves a user to ask what is, making the message that the post seeks to communicate land harder.

This is a tremendously helpful and powerful concept. I had previously thought of visualizations as something that may accompany walls of text in a paper or as something that should have enough information and labels for the user to extract their own story, perhaps with the help of a few sentences of explanation. I hadn't considered a visualization that is built as part of a clear narrative to deliver to the reader, where the narrative is built into the visualization rather than the visualization supporting a wall of text. I think that its power to play on storytelling makes it more effective at communicating its message to the reader, and it makes it more memorable.
