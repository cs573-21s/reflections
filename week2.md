Map of Languages
---
Of the different kind of visualizations that I've found, I think this visualization is particularly unique in how it represents its data. Each section of the image is a language. The colors match the continent that the language is from. The sizes of the different bubbles are proportional to the countries and the languages. Overall design of the figure and the font are very clean and present the information in a very clean way. One of the challenges with coming up with visualizations for certain data types is finding a way to accurately represent proportions. For instance, chinese being spoken by the most number of people doesn't necessarily mean most countries speak chinese. The bottom bits help show an alternate way to view the data shown in the main graphic, for instance English being the most learned and spoken in the most number of countries while not being shown as very big. I think this visualizatoin is effective at providing the user with an intuition with the size of the numbers its representing. It might be interesting to explore similar techniques for the partioning time series data. I think it would be cool to see an animation of how a graphic like this would change over time.
