This week, I chose a hand-drawn visualization of all the squirrel sightings in Central Park in New York City over the course of two weeks in 2018. More than 320 people signed up to help count squirrels in Central Park. By the end of the study, they had concluded that there were 2,373 squirrels in Central Park in 2018. The study was prompted by the Squirrel Census, which is an independent effort started when Jamie Allen, a writer, mentioned that there was no official count of squirrels in Central Park. Once the data was released, Denise Lu, a graphics editor for the New York Times made this visualization in the form of a map of Central Park that also marks where each squirrel was sighted.

I think that this visualization is really cool, especially because the study it was based on answers a really uncommon question that I don't think many people ever think about. I also want to acknowledge the amount of effort that must have gone into drawing a visualization of this size and detail. The map really makes you realize just how many squirrels there are in Central Park, because they almost cover every square inch on the map. This is especially poignant because I think whenever I am in a park, I tend to only notice one or two squirrels even though there are definitely many many more that I don't see.
