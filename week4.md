# Visualizing Country Borders Throughout History (2000 BC - 1994 AD)

I was really intrigued by the application of this data visualization across history and time. Sometimes concepts like these are very hard to represent or explain to someone cohesively.

## Initial Response

My initial thoughts in regards to this visualization, were honestly how do people get the data to create such general visualizations. I thought that it was feasible, but definitely came off as if normalizing all the information would take a bit of time. To me when looking at this vis, data seems to be the challenging portion. Another thing I do wonder is what they used for the timeline. In vis where do you differentiate between a web app and a vis. I probably haven't gotten to the point where I can differentiate when it comes to web based 3d vis'.

## Takeaways

A lot of my takeaways this week, come in more of the form of questions. I wonder whether or not this is simply a web app? If not, what tools are used to animate these types of vis'? It was interesting to see such a dynamic vis but whats behind this stack?
