This visualization goes over the spending habits for different income groups from 1996 vs in 2019. As Nathan Lau mentions in his blurb below the visual, the cost of housing and healthcare for lower income groups has gone up where as in higher income groups, they are putting their money more towards retirement, education, and entertainment. Visually, the color palette looks very nice, and overall the visual is minimal. Even the font is light and adds to the minimalism. I sometimes forget that data visualizations should focus on the actually data and get rid of the extra "pretty stuff". I do think that the color may be hard to distinguish, but to counteract that, the interactivity highlight the lines that correspond with one another. Also because income groups could be put on a spectrum, the color choice where it gradually gets darker from the first quintile to the fifth makes sense. Also, it's helpful to see that the categories are ordered from increased spending to decreased spending. It's a bit hard to realize that the scale on each one is different, but generally I think the focus of the visual is to show spending patterns. Utilizing the lines and their slopes are definetly the way to go to indicate the increase or decrease of spendings. I would have thought to use some sort of pie chart to show the percentage of each quintiles spendings, but it is a lot harder to see the trends over time by just using angles.
