 Category: Exploring approaches use real-world references to enhance the interpretability of the data

This data viz explores enhancing the understanding of the interpretability of the information using real-world objects that are common knowledge to users as reference. The data viz communicates the magnitude of the number of plastic bottles consumed across the globe every day to encourage the users to analyze the gravity of the situation. The viz does have a significant drawback as references remove the quantitative information in the data. The viz addresses this issue of loss of quantitative data by introducing a Sankey diagram that breaks down how the total number of plastic that got discarded incinerated, recycled, or still in use after the first usage between the years 1950 to 2015.

This visualization is an excellent example of how visualization can be very effective at communicating valuable information when the data, although quantitative, is still a probabilistic prediction of the number, using the sample size information, as opposed to real hard numbers.
