This visualization is an interactable simulator that shows how differently-shaped icebergs would orient and float in water. I first found it through a Twitter post commenting on the misconception that icebergs were extremely vertical. It said that this orientation was actually not stable at all, and the icebergs in that shape would float on their side. 

The simulation has a variety of preset iceberg shapes, including the US states, some simple polygons, and other, more fun designs. However, the more interesting option is to draw your own iceberg. Using your mouse, you can draw an iceberg of any shape onto the water, and it will automatically simulate how it would float. This was super interesting to me, as I never really considered that the common depiction of an iceberg was actually unrealistic. 

The simulation also includes additional interesting functions. You can use the 'Poke Iceberg' button to rotate it's orientation and look for an alternative stable one. It also has options for iceberg melting, including 'No Melting', 'More Water Melting', and 'More Air Melting'. Although the melting option is pretty cool, I don't quite understand what it's telling the user as the iceberg melts with the different options. I wonder if there was some specific information the creator was trying to convey. You can also use the 'Show Forces' button, which displays the center of buoyancy and center of gravity of the iceberg. I found this very informative, as it clearly shows why the iceberg orients the way it does. I know nothing about buoyancy, so I was surprised when the center of buoyancy changed as the shape reoriented.

In general, I found this a very interesting simulation to play around with, and I learned more about physics and icebergs in an engaging way.
