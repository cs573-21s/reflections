Here is the link to the visualization I chose for week 4: https://www.cloudred.com/labprojects/nyctrees/#about 

Something that struck me with this visualization is the idea that vis is incredibly useful for making bizarre or complex data sets easily accessible.
Additionally, this vis made me realize jsut how much data vis brings attention to certain aspects of life that people don't normally think about.
I know that next time I go to New York, I'm going to pay extra attention to the trees! 
And over time, I'm going to think about how this data fluctuates over time, depending on climate change, construction, especially how is this dataset is different since 2015.
Something noted under the chart said "With a high concentrations of certain trees, there is a risk of a pathogen, insect or environmental stress wiping out a large amount of trees"
This was an interesting point because I've never really considered that the city must put a lot of thought into something as seemingly simple as planting trees.
I also wonder, if more time and interest allowed, how drastically would the data set differ if it wasn't grouped by genus, or if the unknown species of trees were known?

The interaction component in this vis is particularly interesting because you can highlight multiple data sets at once.
Also, it gives you the ability to switch the tree names from common to Latin, which then rearranges the order distribution of the trees in each borough.
At first I wasn't sold that this was a necessary component, however thinking deeper this could be so useful for researchers who require the scientific names of trees.
Overall this vis is fun, deep, interactive, and very informative, I really loved analyzing it.
