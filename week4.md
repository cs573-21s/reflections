## Timeline: Proportion of Gaming Activity Across Pandemic
https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lvagbz/i_tracked_all_of_my_gaming_time_between_december/

I found this visualization on /r/dataisbeautiful. It's a timeline showing how someone's gaming activity changed over the course of months. I think it's very unique and, to me, it's pleasing to look at. I like the choice of color scheme I think it works well with the off-white background. As far as functionality, the color between different sides of the timeline compliment each other, but there may be more room to take advantage of this parameter. I think the font choices are very clean work well with the graphic.

A lot of people in the comments criticized how the information was portayed. For instance, the y-axis is unconventional, and shows the number of hours originating from the center. People were confused as to whether the hours should be doubled from the center. They also criticized the symmetry of some games, suggesting that one side should be counted more than the other

Personally, while these were things I noticed from my first impression, I didn't find them to be obnoxious or to get in the way of deciphering the meat of the graphic. For instance, some of the games depicted only show up on one side of the graphic, so it can be inferred that games that take up both sides of the graphic represent the cumulative number of hours from adding up the top and bottom parts. As for the symmetry, I think this was just to make the heights above and below the x axis match each other, which I think works well visually. Another thing, even if you weren't trying to figure out the number of hours, I think the proportions of the playtime is very readable.

I think this graphic somewhat sacrifices precision. It can be inferred that each week denotes a data point and the rest is interpolated (A side effect of this is that there are regions in the February month which don't have labels, so it's hard to tell if they correspond to anything). The change in how each game is offset *can* make it difficult to add up the specific number of hours and compare them, but I think this is besides the point for the purpose of this kind of graphic.

I am curious about whether the graphic's design strategy would work if the designer had played many hours consistently over the entire pandemic. Having the game as a strip across the middle might work, but this might effect how the interpolation looks. I'd be interested to learn more about how this graphic was generated.
