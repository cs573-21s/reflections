My teammates for A3 and I were brainstorming some possible graphs to include in our project, and were scrolling through the list of visualizations on [Data Viz Project](https://datavizproject.com/#). The spiral histogram really caught our attention, and I wanted to see what other people had done with this type of visualization in the past. I found the viz *Are Trump's Tweets Spiralling Out of Control* by Neil Richards through this googling process, and I found it really amusing - both the pun in the title, and the viz itself.

In the viz, Richards visualizes a timeline in the form of a spiral: past tweets are closer to the center, and more recent tweets are towards the outside. Each tweet is represented by a colored circle on the spiral - the size of the tweet corresponds to the number of retweets, and the color corresponds to the type of device used to publish the tweet. For example, dark blue is TwitLonger Beta, purple is Twitter Web Client, gray is Twitter for iPhone, and red is Twitter for Android. In the viz, it becomes obvious that as time progresses, the tweets transition from smaller to larger, and more purple to much more red. The transition from purple to red could mean that Trump used to rely on a service to help write the Tweets before he posted, or helped him post directly. I'm not sure, and I feel like this category could be much more specific. However, the transition to red could suggest that Trump began tweeting directly and immediately from his phone without checking with his PR team or anyone else.
