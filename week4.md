For ecah of 250 songs included in the video game Dance Dance Revolution (identified by song name and artist), Shirley Wu has created visualizations of the choreography. Each step is represented as a dot following the spiral pattern. The song begins in the center of the spiral, and the line represents time continuing in the song. 

There are four colors of dots, each corresponding to a different step (left, right, forward, backward). Some steps involve moving in 2 directions, so they have a double dot. 

There are 3 level sof difficulty - "basic" in large dots (behind the other dots), "trick" in medium sized bubbles (in the middle), and "maniac" in small dots (on top so the smaller bubbles can be seen). 

These visualizations encode several different pieces of information. The size of the whole spiral shows the length of the song. The space between dots shows the tempo of the song, since most of the dance steps occurs on a beat. It also shows how many steps overall are in each song for each difficulty level. 

For encoding the length of the song, the spiral is not the most effective method because it is harder to percieve the differences in length when the lines are wrapped up in a spiral rather than laid out for comparison (in a bar chart, for example). The same goes for trying to compare the tempos of the songs - trying to decypher the distance between most of the dots in a song is not the most effective way to get information about the interval of time between beats in the song. 

However, there are several aspects of this vis that make it very effective at encoding several pieces of information at once. The use of different size dots to represent the difficulty levels of each song is effective because you can see them either layered on top of each other, or one by one. The colored dots are also an effective way to convey the type of dance moves, although the dots are rather jumbled due to the spiral pattern with many loops, and there is no one prominent color, so it provides visual interest more than it conveys any signiicant insights.
