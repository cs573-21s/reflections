[Tilt Map: Interactive Transitions Between Choropleth Map, Prism Map and Bar Chart in Immersive Environments](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezpxy-web-p-u01.wpi.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9123548)

I am looking at doing something like a prism map for the final project and thought this article might be relevant however I didn't realize at first glance that it was investigating its utility in VR. Pressing on... The authors perform a study "comparing choropleth, prism and coloured prism maps" in VR. The introduce "Tilt Map, a novel interactively controlled transition between three views: a choropleth, a prism map and a bar chart." This seems pretty cool: "orientation determines the view" - vertical is choropleth, as it tilts goes to prism, nears horizontal goes to bar chart. The authors then perform a study comparing Tilt Map to a side by side view of the three and a toggle controlled view of the three. This is interesting considering we learned that 3d should be used with utmost discrimination in visualization: "It provides further evidence that for geographically embedded data, there can be benefits in utilising a third dimension to show the data variable."

Notes for my benefit: "The choropleth map—where area-"based values are encoded via colour, shading or pattern—is one of the most commonly used thematic map types." Attribute values represented by color or brightness. "A prism map is a 3D choropleth map with extruded height to encode a numerical attribute [3], [4]. Prism maps are quite uncommon."  "Height (the visual variable used by prism maps) is far more accurate for interpreting associated quantitative values than brightness (the visual variable commonly used by choropleth maps) [15], but perspective foreshortening and oblique viewing angles can result in distortion and excessive occlusion in prism maps."

In the first study, users prefered the couloured prism map. Users were more accurate but slower with prism maps compared to choropleth maps. This VR result was similar to results from other studies on 2d monitors. The second study compared Tilt Map to the three views presented in more traditional ways. Tilt Map was more accurate and faster, as well as being strongly preferred by users. 

This was interesting and useful even though I am not interested in VR.
