# Research and Application of Dynamic and Interactive Data Visualization Based On D3

![image](https://github.com/mike3osei/reflections-1/blob/master/img/week10.png) 

This publication describes the entire procedure of dynamic and interactive data visualization from several angles. They use D3 as a basis of this research and look for different advantages or techniques that can make visualization interactive data better. This analysis is conducted by the School of Information Technology, Shanghai Jianqiao University.

## Initial Response

Intitially I found it very intersting how they used different mediums to go about analyzing data-driven visualizations. They mentioned the use of SVG and compared its strong-suites to D3. I personally never heard of anything called a D3 Visualization model but it was interesting hearing how they broke up the workflow into, requirement analysis, data analysis, visualization, and web visualization. They broke up alot of the specific nodes involved in application models into data application layers that reflect back on the actual topic itself. It was interesting seeing their bar chart examples as they were flat but still multidimensional. I was personally pretty interested about how they managed to implement this model.

## Takeaways

I thought it was interesting how they chose to represent their vis' as either grouped or stacked in certain examples. The key technolgoy for interactive or dynamic visualizations is very important in data-driven visualization. I wouldn't think to immediately think about that realm, but it was important to bring up for sure.
