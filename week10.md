[Distributed Synchronous Visualization Design:
Challenges and Strategies

This paper goes over the experiences of designers of data visualizations for COVID-19 data is a distributed sychronous space, meaning that the team worked at the same time but in differenet places. Like many activities, designing and meeting with one another is often done over Zoom or a different video calling service. a lot of the methodologies we learn for the design process is assumed to be in person, so it was interesting to see how they go about it given the current circumstances. Some of the tools they used included Zoom, Miro Board, Google Docs, and Slack. Activities like sketching were essential, so the team would either hold the physical sketches to the camera while on Zoom or post them on Miro Board. Of course there are still obstacles such as a delay when posting sketches or not being able to reference the them when just holding them up to the camera. One of the strategies they presented for sketching is using 2 cameras per person. One would capture the team member (webcam) and the other would capture the paper/sketch (phone camera). This promoted a more natural conversation (such as seeing facial expressions) while still being able to see real-time sketching. Screensharing also allowed for collaboration or for the team to use applications that allowed for multiple people to work on the same workspace. To help mimic interaction or animation, they found that the best way for them was to just utilize their cameras and express the interaction through their hands, such as using paper to manipulate. For prototyping, they utilized Miro and exported Illustrator assets to it. There, the team somewhat mimicked paper prototyping with the benefit that they could group and duplicate elements.
