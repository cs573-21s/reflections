This paper talks about the use of virtual reality in order to help comprehend visualizations. A primary purpose of data visualizations is to help people understand raw data and what it might mean. However, there is a lot that can be lost in translation or misleading, depending on how the information is actually shown. The paper introduces an approach called data visceralization, where basic units of measurement are reintroduced for greater understanding. The authors use virtual reality to create prototypes of how data visceralization can better communicate comparisons and other information. For example, in the figure above, it is much easier to see the difference in skyscraper heights in a virtual reality space, where the physical scale is the same as that of real life. 

In general, I see a lot of potential with virtual reality being used to display data effectively. As VR workspaces have become somewhat more prevalent, I wonder if people will begin doing data analysis completely in virtual reality. That being said, there are definitely clear restraints with the VR approach for data visceralization. More abstract kinds of data will not have a literal form to be shown in, as well as things that are not in sizes easily comparable by human eye. I am excited to see more user studies on this concept and how it may be applied!
