MTFeedback Providing Notifications to enhance teacher awareness of small group work in the classroom

This screen shot shows a dashboard in figure 3 for a teacher to track group activity progress for students in real-time. It also allows teacher/tutor to interface with the sutdents and track their progress, current work and next steps. The figure 4 shows an example of the notification teachers receive when they need to alerted with high priority events that needs to be brought to their attention.

Category: Visualizations in Teaching Augmentation using advanced technology integration into classrooms

This research explores the effectiveness of exploring teaching augmentation using advanced technology integration in classrooms with visualization components that users can interact with in classrooms. The research relies on several "Principles of learning sciences" which encourages students to work in groups. The students work on computers assigned to their respective work tables and their progress can be tracked by the teacher in real-time. The teacher can also control their progress and their next assignments while working on the lesson. This allows the teacher to identify student progress and also customize their progress to suit the needs of the group. This is very important as it allows the teacher to customize individual group experience independently.  

The most common implementation of Data-Viz in Ed-Tech that helps track student progress in real-time is to is to implement dashboards that help teachers identify students who are struggling. This work shows an excellent proof of concept where the research has leveraged the advanced technology to enhance learning experience. We do need to point out that the fact that this research used advanced technology in classrooms which can present feasibility challenges at scale.
