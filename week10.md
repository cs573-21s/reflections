For today I read an article related not directly to visualization but related to the final project. I thought this article would be relevant because it has to do with farm-specific modeling which is what I had in mind for the project: data visualization that could be directly useful for farmers. I thought reading it could give me ideas for the project. 

The introduction mentions visualization of information as an important aspect of enabling decision making for farmers which was a driver of the project idea. The article mentions GPS enabled collars for livestock which is something I had not considered looking in to. Doing something with grazing plans is an interesting idea to me. 

The article goes on to talk about models that predict things like milk yield and methane emissions which is not the type of information I was looking for. It goes on to talk about sensors. Overall this paper was not helpful or what I anticipated.
