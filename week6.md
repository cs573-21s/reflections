### Summary
The visualization I examined this week is a connected scatterplot that explores the relationship between how many vehicles are on the road in the United States and how many vehicular fatalities there are for each year studied. It's a very interesting visualization because time doesn't have its own axis, so the data points themselves can move back and forth and even loop as time progresses. 

In his video, Eagereyes points out how this graph comes with interesting properties that shift how time-based trends display themselves. Since each dot is one year, the dots that are further apart show more dramatic shifts than the ones closer together. This format also does an excellent job at highlighting where the trend changes: whenever the graph has an "elbow." Eagereyes finishes by mentioning that connected scatterplots are rare because it is uncommon to find data that is well-suited for them. The data's shape needs to be sparse and not crowd over itself too much.

### Analysis
I think that treating time like this is a really concept for a visualization. I like the idea of time not having its own spatial axis to allow more variables to fit onto a 2D space. I especially love how the sharp bends between trends naturally create space for captions to explain the trends in the data. I'm really interested in seeing how else a visualization can represent time parametrically to allow more variables to coexist in a smaller space. I'm interested to see a visualization that shows contours of trends at fixed points in time that can be controlled with a slider. I'm also interested to see more visualizations that so elegantly annotate the changes in trends in the graph's own negative space.
