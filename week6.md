This is a really cool and interactive visualization that turns the brightest places on Earth into mountains. The different elevations 
indicate the amount of artificial light used in an area. Unfortunately, my laptop couldn't handle the visual all that well, but while it wasn't the smoothest, it still
was very beautiful and showed what it wanted to show. The use of color is very effective and it highlights the the brightest arreas. The designer has a version of the 
visual, but with a satellite imagery. While it's still cool, I feel that the dark blue and yellow are far more effective in getting the message across. The map is also very easy
to manuver through, and while it's 3D, you can still easity tell what's going on. The line indicating a location is also very effective in distinguishing areas and making the visual 
easier to perceive. Honestly, I found it surprising that there were areas that didn't have as much light. For example, I thought the US would have been all lit up. Also, I didn't 
realize how much articial light was being used in parts of India. Overall, it's just a really beautiful visualization and a super effective way to convey the information.
