## Reflection6
What I found in this week is a paper to illustrate an idea about redesigning chart which is poor designed. For example, there is a pie chart showing in figure 1. We can notice that slices are ordered haphazardly, labels are placed erratically, and label text competes with saturated background colors.

Thus, the author proposed a process to redesign poor designed chart. First step is Classifying Visualization Images. Second step is extracting Marks from Charts. Finally, Automated Visualization Design.

Figure 2 shows the pipeline indicating how to classify the type of chart and extract marks.
As a result, we can get a redesigned chart, as shown in Figure 3.

What impressed me most is that this technology combines computer vision and data visualization. I also like the idea that redesign poor designed chart to enable people have a better cognition.
