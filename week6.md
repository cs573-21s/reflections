This visualization is by the fondation follereau. The goal of the vis was to promote the quality of life of vulnerable African communitites. They showcase the countries budget size vs. their health projects, education projects, protection projects, and emergency projects. On the highest layer of the tree they discuss the major projects in the region.

## Initial Response

My initial thoughts in regards to this visualization were that it was pretty powerful that we could interact with such a large project. I know it was mentioned by the contributors that this project took a lot of funding to actually make happen. With that being said its pretty amazing to see all the entire picture as you go up the tree of specific countries. I have not really explored this approach before yet. I thought it was also interesting that the mentioned their conclusion as well. Showcasing practical ways to help and the future of new iterrations of this vis. I thought this was very interesting.

## Takeaways

One of my takeaways from this visualization was that it made great use of branding as a storytelling medium. Branding in this vis was great for making sense of what was going on in the vis. I thought it was great that they were also able to add illustrations of the people from the countries in their native garments around the vis. I thought it was all well thought out.
