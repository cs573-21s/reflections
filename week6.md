[The Rhythm of Food](http://rhythm-of-food.net/)

I found this visualization through Moritz Stefaner's website Truth & Beauty. I selected this one to look at because food and farming is my #1 interest. I had high hopes for it. I think the visualization is beautiful but I didn't find it very interesting. The use of color to encode year wasn't effective for me. I also didn't find the interactive element very interesting or effective. What does 'worldwide google search volume' mean anyway? Excuse my overcritical personal opinions. I guess I'm just not that interested in big data. 

It is interesting to see the patterns in the data. They used a radial spatial orientation which is compatible with the cyclic range of a year. The timelapse animation in the detail view is neat. 

Further exploring his website led me to their workshops exploring using food to visualize data which I found fun and interesteing [Data Cuisine](http://data-cuisine.net/data-dishes/)
