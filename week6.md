Category: What it boils down to is effective communication

This week I browsed the internet for data viz that were simpler to interpret and analyze but was very effective at communicating the information. Here the data represents the risk of contracting COVID at various social gatherings and how they can be broken down into high level categories of(low, medium and high risks) and the color code associated with each activity also helps users extrapolate information. Here it is obvious that nightclub is the most dangerous place with concert, plays, indoor parties, indoor bars, stadium and church coming pretty close. On the other hand outdoor exercise, tennis, golf, and petrol station are low risk activities. I was particularly surprised by how low the risk associated with petrol pumps are. It would also be very interesting to analyze this data and test it's validity as we now have access to more data.
