This viz shows different examples of things that increase or decrease a human lifespan. I really like the design of this one. It's very clear what information is being represented. The fun facts on the side are aligned. The choice of font mathces the clean aesthetic of the graphic. I like the color scheme and how they are organized in a gradient. To me, this makes it visually easy to see which of the entries correspond to what, which is especially helpful because the kinds of things that can increase/decrease lifespan can be unrelated to one another. However, I do think a different attribute than strength of science would have been better to use color for, as the descriptor is kind of vague and without any follow-up of what constitutes the strength (e.g. number of studies). I also think it's hard to distinguish correlation and causation for some of the variables. For instance, living at a high altitude. The bottom purple bar at the bottom is obviously a satirical take on this gray area. While I think many included variables are expected, I think it's interesting that it shows which are the most significant and how many years are represented. Although again, it's unclear as to whether any of the variables have a proper control group. For instance, being rich given the same health conditions.
