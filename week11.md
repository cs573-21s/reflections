[ThemeRiver: visualizing theme changes over time](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885098)

For this week, I decided to read over one of the papers I was referencing for my final project. In this paper, the team devleoped a prototype system alled ThemeRiver which is used to visualize "thematic variations over tiem within a large collection fo documents". The goal of the project was th present the themes so that the audience can easliy find patterns, which is the goal of my project. To do this, instead of using a histogram, ThemeRiver connects the different points at each time to create curves and show changes over time. When testing the prototype, the users said that conectedness "helped them follow a trend more easily than in the histogram". I am still a bit unsure of this because of the perceptual effectiveness of bar graphs versus other visualizations. I realize that ThemeRiver is essentially a bunch of stacked bar graphs that are connected, so being able to see major changes wouldn't be too bad. However, if it were someone's first time looking at a the prototype, I can understand how it would be confusing. I think also the symmetry of ThemeRiver is a bit confusing as well. Because it is symmetric along the x axis, viewers may think there is a negative value associated with the visualization. I know in class, we've looked at a couple of visuals similar to this and people have mentioned it seems like it is more for the aesthetic of the visual than the actual practicality.
