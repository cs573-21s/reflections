# DATAVIS HELPER: A TOOL FOR EXPLORING THE DESIGN SPACE OF DATA VISUALIZATION

![image](https://github.com/mike3osei/reflections-1/blob/master/img/week11.png) 

This publication describes the development of a tool that could be used in academia as well as the real world. This tool was meant for exploring the design space of data visualization. They state that the idea is to develop a web tool that applies the principles of visual encoding. The testing was done in two cohorts. They were looking for people without any specific datavis background.

## Initial Response

Intitially I found it very intersting how they managed to developed a platform meant for developing these forms of visualization. The UI was typical with graidents and so forth, but I was very unimpressed by how the userflow worked. I think with datavis it's important to be able to guide users.

## Takeaways

I thought it was interesting how they managed to develop their inferface design for their testing group. When doing visual analysis its important to have a great UI that is simple to use. A lot of the target audience here was initial users that may not be comfortable with an environment like virtual testing. It's important to note that I feel that this research paper didn't do a great job in that regard and I wonder if that would affect the end results.
