Activity River
-----------------
- Using visualization elements to surmise information from visual elements
- Explore the usefulness of different visual components when the primary focus of the user's attention is not the visual component

Figure 1: Screenshot showing Activity River dashboard used in the first paper.

This screenshot shows a dashboard that helps the user visualize their actions in a timeline where the user can toggle between activities(take actions) and analyze their current and past activities while working on tasks. There are multiple components of the visual element where the user can quickly infer their activity information and interact with the visualization where they can change their activity states.

Category: Integrating Visualizations in **physically or cognitively active users** where the visual component is not the primary focus.

The first research paper **Activity River** explores the effectiveness of exploring visualization in domains where the user is actively engaged in tasks where they are primarily engaged in tackling a task that is physically or cognitively demanding. The visualization is a tool that facilitates reflection to the users in the future or the ability to quickly extrapolate high-level information at a glance.

Figure 2: The three different types of feedback given to users.

The second research paper is not entirely related to the first paper but I found the work relevant to the current stream of exploration I am doing around data viz work. This paper explore the design and development of real-time visualization using smart watches that explores the use of feedback to improve the runners gait during the run and the effective intervals at which the feedback should be provided. Additionally the paper also explores the usage of graphical feedback in short intervals, graphical feedback in long intervals and textual feedback based on short time intervals. The visualization for the three different types of feedback can be seen on figure 2 above. On a high-level the feedback with long interval(90 seconds) was found to be the most effective at correcting running technique.
