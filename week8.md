[Exploring How Personality Models Information Visualization Preferences](https://virtual.ieeevis.org/paper_s-short-1204.html)

The study focused on whether personality afffects a user's preferences for different visualizations, specifically in hierarchy, evolution over time, and comparison contexts. I chose to read this because it seemed like an interesting concept since a person's personality affects the way they think about the world and their surroundings. If this is the case, people with different personalities should have some preference over different idioms. To collect the necessary data, the research team collected the Five-Factor Model (FFM) personality traits and each of its facets, as well as the dimensions of the Locus of Control (LoC) for each participants. Both are well researched personality models. From there, participants were asked for their preference for an idiom based on a 7-point Likert scale (Low Preference (1) to High Preference(7)). When analyzing the data, the researchers did a correlation-based analysis and a cluster-based analysis. Based on the correlation-based analysis, all of their results were insignificant due to the Bonferroni correction to eliminate multiple comparrison problem. However they found some correlations with different personality traits, such as "Neuroticism, Openness to Experience and Agreeableness show weak negative effects with line charts..., area charts... and sunburst". When doing the Cluster-based analysis there were more prominent results. The data was broken up into 3 clusters. The first had participants with the highest levels of Conscientiosness aned Internal dimension. The second cluster had the lowest values for Conscientiousness and the third had the highest levels on Neuroticism and both the External dimensions.

However even with the results, given everyone's preference for the horizontal bar chart, context may have a stronger role in someone's preference than personality. It was a bit disappointing for me to read since a lot of the results were not significant. However, I do think this was an interesting study and that visualizations are not one-size-fits-all.
