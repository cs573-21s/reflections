Category: Visualizations in Teaching Augmentation

This paper explores the effectiveness of exploring teaching augmentation using Virtual Reality glasses that allows a teacher to track their student progress in real-time while they are working on classwork. The paper explores different data visualization types to examine the use of VR in real-time analytics of student progress. The paper explores the effectiveness of using Virtual Reality, Business as usual and Virtual Reality with student performance analytics. The paper's real take away was their ability to close the achievement gap between high-performing and low-performing students, which is very difficult to achieve. The visualization uses the virtual space while also ensuring that there are certain areas fixed for certain information so that the teacher always understands where the relevant information is displayed.
