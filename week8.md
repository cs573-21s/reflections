This paper discusses the theories and provides guidance on how to bridge the divide between the evaluation of decision-making in visualization and psychology research. Psychological researchers have demonstrated that decision-making is based on quantitative reasoning and gist-based intuition. However, visualization researchers tend not to focus on these two separate systems when evaluating the impact of visualization design on decision-making.

People's decisions are based primarily on two types of reasoning: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is responsible for our intuition and pattern recognition while Type 2 is centered around analytical thinking. It is only through combining these two processes that we make our decisions, whether trivial or complex. Data visualizations can be a crucial part of how we make some of our decisions. Thus, it is important to look more holistically at the decision-making process when creating and analyzing them. For example, there was a study that evaluated visualizations based on participants' estimates on likeliness of bus arrival times on a scale of 0 to 100. Because the participants were prompted on a numerical scale, they were more likely to use their Type 2 reasoning, when in reality, Type 1 affects decision-making to a greater scale. It is hard to know if the results from this study could apply to real-life situations unless both types of reasoning are analyzed. If visualizations are created with these types of decision-making in mind, they can greater and more accurately influence how people act.
