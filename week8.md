This publication describes the evolution of spacial data analysis in the Data Vis space. David Kahle and Hadley Wickham go through the creation of the ggmap tool. They describe how it can be used with open source APIs such as Google Geocoding, Distance Matrix, and Directions APIs.

## Initial Response

Intitially I found it very intersting as a Computer Science student how different data vis tools are created. Maybe not how they are created but what can go behind inspiring the new adoption or creation of a datavis tool. Like most innovation, creative ideas come from challenging task out there in the world and trying to simplify such things. This paper describes how one could evolve ggplot2 with the introduction of ggmap. They describe the challenges of spacial data being visualized in R, which is interesting given how one technology can be good for one thing but maybe not good for another.

## Takeaways

I thought it was interesting how with the introduction of a tool like ggmap, you can see other tools be generated based on the inital pain the was felt in the original R environment. Like they used that crux as a means of doing more. I feel like I can for sure take this away in my work in the future. Another takeaway with tools, is that less is always more. Creating a function with limited inputs but enough to create graphs quickly was very important in this example.
