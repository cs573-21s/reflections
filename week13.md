# Graphical representation of multivariate data using Chernoff faces

The article describes the use of cartoon-like faces to represent value changes in a dataset. According to this article, they implemented a Stata implementation of a face-generating algorithm. Apparently Chernoff proposed a way of showcasing multivariable data as cartoon faces. They describe this as a way of generating results that are more simple to remember.

## Initial Response
I thought it was interesting the use of scale in the context of data visualization. I didn't think that a face, given its emotions, complexity, and features could give out that many expressions. I found it interesting that something as simple as outliers can be hard to measure due to the cernoff measurements.

## Takeaways
I found it interesting that they were pretty optimistic about the future interations of the Chernoff face. They mentioned how it would evovle if they had had time to fine-tune it. For instance, having a limits implementation would be very important in said case. Faces, can help detect trends and patterns which can be very useful moving forward.
