[Visualization of Eye Tracking Data: A Taxonomy and Survey](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cgf.13079?casa_token=tlm90VhFABkAAAAA%3A-w6AKFEx3Vv2gM_5ycb3q4i7BpF3RxrlswpLqeBBuaQK98GI5HM7YiVwbPBf2HtVjGmsSmyfj1v8qa0)

So I chose to read this paper because I'm currently learning about eye tracking in MIS583 and I know that there can be a lot of data that can be extracted by using it. The researchers read a bunch of different papers on eyetracking and their findings on that. With that information, they created a taxonomy that categorized them into point-based visualizations, AOI-based visualizations, and visualizations that utlize both. They categorized them even further into temporal, spatial or spatiotemporal based on the data represented in each of the papers. With their categorization, they believe that researchers can use it to choose the most appropriate visualization technique for their data. I definetly can see how this can be useful, especially because there's so many variables you can focus on. Something that one of the experts said during their interviews stood out to me. They said that "Manufacturers who are eager to sell tend to promise that visualizations will solve the researchers problems, when in most cases, they do not". In addition to that, another expert says that, "Researchers should be trained in how to use visualizations". They have all this data and without selecting the right visualization, that may skew the the interpretation of the data. Having a framework/categorization like the one provided in this paper is a great start to what visualization techniques would be most useful for each research question.
