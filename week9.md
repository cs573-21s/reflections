For this week's visualization I chose a paper by Narra Vivek Reddy and Yashaswini Julapally called Evaluation for an Effective Data
Visualization Method in Safety Radar System Demonstrator published in October 2020. The premise of the paper is to examine different data visualization methods for displaying radar data. The paper goes over four different types of plots: time-domain, scatterplot, contour plots and heat temperature plots. The authors conduct the experiment through semi-structured interviews of fourteen different people, seven of which use the radar and seven students. They conclude that the fifty-seven percent of participants say that the heat-temperature plot is the best for displaying radar data. Although this paper is specifically for data visualizations of radar data, I think this experiment could be applied to any field to find the most effective data visualization method for any type of data.
