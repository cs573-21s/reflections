This paper discusses using a combination of large interactive displays and personal head-mounted Augmented Reality for information visualization. With multivariate data, it is helpful for everyone to be able to see the general information on a large display, while each individual can analyze their own interests in more detail in an AR space. Big displays are generally effective at displaying complex data due to their size, but an AR component allows each person looking at the screen to make their own decisions about what to interact with in-depth.

As seen in the figures above, there are many possible ways to show more data in AR in conjunction with a primary display. I was most intrigued by AR brushing and linking (as seen in Fig. 8). With this tool, analysts can create connections in 3D space. Additionally, specific links can be sorted and looked at individually without disturbing others. 
                     
As a Unity game developer, I am interested in the potential AR has for conveying information, so I thought this was a very interesting concept. Additionally, the authors implemented their own Unity visualization framework for interactive data visualization. As there is no particularly easy way to show data in Unity, this framework could be immensely useful for depicting charts in 2D or 3D, in the AR space or not. I am interested in seeing the capabilities of this framework for uses such as displaying in-game stats and information.
