Category: Visualizations in Teaching Augmentation using peripheral visual agents
----------------------------------------------------------

This research explores the effectiveness of exploring teaching augmentation using physical **Low Fidelity(Lo-fi)** visualization components that users can interact with. The components allows students and teachers to interact with each other in a noninvasive manner where the students can work independently without being disturbed while also ensuring that the teachers can address student needs in real-time. The work has shown how the effective use of Lo-fi visual component can result in overall effectiveness of instructions in classrooms. This work is profound to Data-Viz researches working in education in so many levels as it focuses on increasing the opportunity to address student needs while allowing them to exercise **persistence and autonomy** which has always been challenging in Ed-Tech domain.

The most common implementation of Data-Viz in Ed-Tech that helps track student progress in real-time is to is to implement dashboards that help teachers identify students who are struggling. This design if problematic because the teacher has the opportunity to intervene before the student asks for help which is worrying as persistence is one of the few characteristic traits in students that are reliably significant predictors **[This has been replicated enough times that it is accepted as a reliable claim which is why I didn't feel the need to add any reference papers.]** of post-test performance and learning.
