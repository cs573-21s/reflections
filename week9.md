Paper Summary
---
Hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs) are "animated representations of outcomes drawn from distributions" and are used to visualize uncertainty. In this paper, Alex Kale, Francis Nguyen, Matthew Kay, and Jessica Hullman discuss how they found that when the data has a lower level of evidence, people are able to read HOPs better than static uncertainty visualizations when attempting to understand the overall trend.

The authors conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, they compared HOPs to error bars when making decisions. Participants were asked to roleplay a newspaper editor who is given a bunch of bar charts that visualize how many jobs are added to the market. Based on the visualization, they would then determine whether there was any growth, and indicate how confident they were in that answer. They found that participants are better at seeing trends in noisy data when using HOPs than when using error bars.

In the second experiment, the authors compared line HOPs to static line charts. Again, the author found that participants were better at finding trends in the line HOPs than the static line charts.

Thoughts

I read this paper for background information for my group's final project. I hadn't known that animations could be so useful in interpreting the noisiness of data - I had thought that it would be hard to remember the differences between different frames of the animation. So it was really cool to learn that the opposite was true!
