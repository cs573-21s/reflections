I was drawn to this visualization mainly because I was amused by the pun, but I think it has other good qualities as well. Because pi is irrational number and thus has infinite digits, a video is a good representation of them as it can iterate through each digit and update the chart. Additionally, the colors and layout are simple, but it is easy to tell what each slice of the pie chart represents. In class, we learned recently that a bar chart is more clear for comparing sizes. That being said, I think a pie chart is a good representation for this information, as it allows you to see the ratios as part of the whole number.

Even though it is a nice visualization, I do feel that more could have been done visually to make it more appealing. The simplest is changing the colors, as right now they are all a bit dull on a dull background. Some colors are used twice, giving the illusion of some sort of grouping when there is none in reality. It would be nicer if each slice of the chart was a different more vibrant color on an either light or very dark background. The background color also makes it a bit hard to see the numbers each slice is representing, so a higher contrast, combined with a larger size for the numbers, would be nice.
