This paper explores the effectiveness of conducting a real-time multimodal analysis of student engagement in classroom by helping inform teachers about the overall class engagement as well as the the individual student information about their engagement. This is a challenging problem in the field of Data Viz and I really like the approach the researches took in this paper to tackle the problem. They arranged the students to reflect the classroom seating arrangement and monitored them in real-time while they were working on their assignments on computers. It then allowed teachers insight into student engagement and ability to take actions if the students needed additional intervention from the teacher. This paper was published in 2019 before the pandemic and it's relevance/value has significantly during the COVID-19 shut down where students are working from home taking virtual classes.
