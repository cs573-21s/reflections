For this week's visualization I chose one from Reddit's /r/dataisbeautiful. It's a chart showing the trend of Apple Maps routing requests from March 2020 to March 2021. There are three trendlines, one for driving, transit and walking. As the chart displays, all three modes of transportation dipped as soon as the pandemic began in March 2020 but driving and walking ticked back up again beginning in about May and ended up back at normal pre-pandemic levels in July / August. The chart also shows that routing requests that included transit never came back up after the pandemic which makes sense to me considering the high congestion of public transit and therefore the high possibility of contracting COVID-19.

I thought that the chart was really interesting because I went into work for my internship in the summer of 2020 and to get there, I needed to drive on Rt.128 from my house which, in normal pre-pandemic times is bumper to bumper traffic in the mornings because everyone is trying to get to work. The chart was especially believable because it really tracked with my experience driving to work and few times a week during that summer. There was very little traffic in the mornings that gradually became more and more as the months went on. It's also interesting that it says that routing requests are now back to normal which is interesting to me because I know very few people who are actually back to working in person rather than working from home.
