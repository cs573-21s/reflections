For this week's visualization I chose a paper by Alyssa A. Goodman, Harvard University, Michelle A. Borkin, Northeastern University and Thomas P. Robitaille, Aperio Software Ltd. called New Thinking on, and with, Data Visualization published in 2018. The premise of the paper is to start a conversation about the role of data visualizations today and best practices for the training of scientists in data visualization practices.

The paper also goes over a new software called glue, which was developed by the authors of the paper and provides a flexible system that facilitates easy travel between exploratory and explanatory data visualization. The glue software is designed to be used for visualizations across disciplines such as astronomy, medicine, and geographical information science.

The paper concludes with two provocations and one suggestion. One, computer scientists need to stop using the word "workflow" to describe a scientist's process because there is no longer a one-way "workflow" from exploratory to explanatory work. Two, scientists need to invest time to explore visualization research and opportunities. Third, the authors suggest more papers like the one they wrote, to spark more conversations between scientists and visualization experts to facilitate breakthroughs.
