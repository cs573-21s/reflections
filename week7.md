I chose this recent article on multiple-view visualization (MV) as an attempt to get further clarity and inspiration on assignment 4. The authors collected and analyzed 360 MV designs from the literature (view type and view layout), and present an "interactive recommendation system for designing MVs" based on the analysis. They also performed a user study to assess the effectiveness of the system. They also developed an interactive website related to the article [https://mvlandscape.bitbucket.io/](https://mvlandscape.bitbucket.io/). The website has links to the supplementary material and includes examples of the different view layouts. In exploration mode users can select View Type, Number of Views, and Layout to filter and see MVs that match those criteria from the 360 that were analyzed. There is also a design mode where a user can "'draw' their desired MV design, and the system will search through the database of MV designs to recommend the closest existing designs." I found this interesting but can't tell how useful it will be. I will be looking at the website more for examples of MVs to inform assignment 4.
