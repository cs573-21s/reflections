I can honestly say that up until this day, I had never intentionally looked up an actual data visualization in my life before. Coming from a CS, UI/UX background that can probably come off as a shock to most. One thing I can say is that I do take visual design very seriously so it was definitely hard to pick one visualization. Something that did stop me while scrolling and looking through whats out there was this visualization of United States Inaguaral Addresses from 1789 to 2021.

## Initial Response

Initially I did think it was pretty powerful how they emphasized certain words throughout certain addresses. It did make me pretty skeptical that there was definitely a big bias involved because the words that were emphasized seemed to be from the designers point of view versus the speakers point of view. I could be wrong about that but that was my initial assumption.

I did find it super impressive that someone like myself, who probably won't be reading any of these addresses anytime soon, was able to take something away from that specific time period. That definitely was powerful and pretty big for me. 

## Takeaways

I immediately took away something from my experience interacting with this visualization which is something I defintiely want to do with my own future visualizations. I think thats definitely major as a designer, being able to have such impact.
