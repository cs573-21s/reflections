What I found this week is a set of line charts that shows us the most important factor affecting climate change since 1880. The author mainly considers two types of factors, one is human factors, and the other is natural factors. First, the author draws line chart of observed temperature changes. Then, the author draws line charts of the influence of the sun and the earthâ€™s orbit and volcanoes on temperature separably and each chart was compared with line chart of observed temperature change. These charts shows that these influences on temperature are negligible. Then author combines line chart of the influence of these three natural facts on temperature, the result shows that the combined effects of these three factors are also small. 
Then, the author draws line charts of the influence of the deforestation and ozone pollution and aerosol pollution on temperature separably. Among them, greenhouse gases have the greatest impact on the climate change, and the others have little impact. Finally, the author combines all the line charts that affect the climate change into one line, and the trend of this line matches observed temperature trend, so it turns out that greenhouse gases are the most important cause of climate change.
What attracts me to this case is that it combines many line charts into one line chart to show the impact of various factors on the climate change. It can let the viewers have a more intuitive experience of the changes in the impact of various factors. Under this design, I think result becomes more convincing.
