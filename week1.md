I chose a visualization found on twitter regarding the rise of renewable energy in 28 countries of the European Union. I really like this visualization because it’s immediately clear what the intention of the image is. There is a stark contrast in color, the gray and black look dull next to the bright green, immediately calling attention to the trend of renewable resources, thus the point of the graphic. It’s also important to note that the design shows the overall trend on the left, and individual countries’ trends on the right. This is to help show which places are actually contributing to the rise of renewable energy and which are staying fairly constant over the years.
	Representing the data “stacked” in this way really helps to compare the numbers that might appear more insignificant without the picture (the tables show some countries the use of nuclear and renewable energy follows parallel paths). While I liked the green, I think the nuclear resources should be colored gray and fossil fuels black. Nuclear resources can be dangerous but if used correctly they can do really efficient things, so I think the lighter color would express that better. I also think it would give more contrast to the countries that only use fossil fuels and renewable resources.
