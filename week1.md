# Week 1 Reflection - Definition of Data Visualization

The world of data visualization has a history dating back to the beginning of human information transference. Ideas such as plantary motions, population density maps, linear regression, and so many more are more easily represented using data visualization. As such, it has major backings in many fields including Statistics and Graphic Design. However, what defines data visualization? It's definition seems to have such a broad scope that its association could literally mean anything. To combat this, I hope to limit the scope of what it means when we say data visualization.

First, how is data visualization normally defined? According to most references, it is simply a "graphical representation of data". The issue with this definition has to do with the word 'data'. What defines what can be considered data? Data is just information that is collected and stored. Everything a human sees can be considered to be a "graphical representation of data" since the rays of light collected by the cones and rods in the eyes are converted into a viewable picture for your brain to interpret and use in everyday life. As such, a human will always see a visualization of data. If we cast aside this point and talk purely from a computer standpoint, it brings up the same issue. Every single bit stored within the internal memory is a collection of data points that either remains static (ROM) or actively updates (RAM). The computer then transpiles that information into a valid graphics data which is rendered to the screen. This can also be considered to be data visualization. The definition is quite broad that when we use the term data visualization, it could be anything a human sees, a computer might show, a person might write, etc.

So, let's clarify a few definitions starting with the examples mentioned above. The first form of data visualization mentioned when light enters the eye and converts it into electrical impulses for the brain to use is a combination of photoreceptors and signal decoding. While a form of data visualization, it is an everyday application of using human sight. As for the second form when computers display graphical data onto a screen or monitor, this is done by sending data to some graphics card with its own internal memory (VRAM) and displaying the data as either emitted light or light modulation. While these both fall under the formal definition, their actual inner workings do not necessarily conform to what we associated with the word.

What could be a definition of 'data visualization' then? When we use this word, we generally talk about encoding a processed dataset within some sort of visual representation of shapes that can be used to more intuitively interpret the data in a meaninful manner. So, when we talk about about data visualization, we are actually discussing a graphical representation of data that allows an everyday consumer to better anaylze and view the results of some observation. While this still might cover the previews of the other two definitions, it limits the scope to that where we are trying to communicate the meaning behind the data rather than just what the data is itself. This is why I said to try and limit the scope rather than provide a clearer definition. Creating a more clearer definition is pointless, rather it is better to limit the already existing scope to consider the everyday usecase.
