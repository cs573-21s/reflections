While looking for inspiration for assignment 1, I stumbled across this visualization of every line in the musical "Hamilton". 
As explained on the visualization, "Each circle is a set of lines, colored by singer", and you can hover over the circle to reveal the lyrics. 
Overall, it was a super interactive visualization, allowing you to see the different relationships between characters and themes sung by who. 

Typically when I think of data visualization, I assume the data being used is quantitative. Because this visualization is showing qualitative data, 
I thought it was an interesting and effective way of displaying that information.

The color use was also very effective and was the key distinguisher for differentiating each character for each of the circles. In addition, the 
circles were a good design choice in this case because any other shape may have been too busy or not as appealing. The circle animation throughout 
the website ties all the different visuals together by having them disperse and then forming the next visual. The animation was definitely a strong point, 
especially in the storytelling. The designer would show her findings and exploration by highlighting different areas of the data as you scrolled along. 
Also, because there was a lot of data, the interactivity helped limit the amount of information being displayed all once. Overall, I thought it was a cool 
and appealing way to show off "Hamilton". While I do know a couple of the songs, I have yet to watch the whole musical. The visualization just offered a 
sneak peak of what I should expect when I eventually watch it.
