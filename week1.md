The visualization I found for this week is a tree grouping of English dialects from a post on r/dataisbeautiful. It's not a novel style of data visualization, but it's new to me, so I want to talk about some of my thoughts on it.

I think it's really interesting to see the different categories and subcategories, especially with most sub-categories having a close color to their super-category, but I feel that this visualization falls short of its potential. Most of the colors for sub-categories are unhelpfully close to each other, making it needlessly difficult to determine which super-category they belong to. I also think that this visualization would be more helpful if similar regions were closer to each other in the diagram (for example, if New York City and Western Pennsylvania did not have Philippine between them). It would also be interesting to me to see this visualization spread out more so that distinct categories could be further apart and so that its nature as a tree would be more visually apparent.

I would be really interested to see a remix of this diagram to show how many people speak each of these dialects represented by area or bar length. I think at that point it might be more useful to use the grid visualization that breaks down categories as you zoom in or as some kind of nested pie chart. I haven't thought too much about hierarchical data visualizations, and now I'm seeing how these styles of diagram would be useful.

I spent a bit of time searching for such a pie chart to see if I could find a better visualization to compare this one to, but all I could find was this [static pie chart](https://www.conceptdraw.com/examples/chart-pie-png).

I found an [unrelated nested pie chart](https://www.displayr.com/why-pie-charts-are-better-than-bar-charts/), but I can't seem to find what I'm looking for.
