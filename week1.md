For this week's reflection, I looked at a series of charts generated by Eric Roston for a Bloomberg article. In the article, he uses the charts to demonstrate the cause of global warming. He shows the observed land-ocean temperature for the earth compared with the effect on temperature by different factors, including orbital changes, deforestation, solar temperature, volcanic effects, ozone pollution, aerosol pollution, or greenhouse gases.

One graph shows all of the natural factors plus the temperature of the earth combined into one graph which shows that the natural factors (volcanic, solar temperature, orbital changes) really have no effect on the temperature of the earth. The only graph that really shows any correlation with the temperature of the earth is the graph with greenhouse gases. All other graphs with the other human factors (aerosol pollution, ozone pollution, deforestation) shows the same effects as the natural factors which is no effects on the temperature of the earth.
