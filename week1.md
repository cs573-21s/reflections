Week 1 Reflection

My interest is in AgTech and regenerative agriculture. So my goal is to find visualizations related to that from organizations that I follow. I found this on the Twitter of Savory Institute and tracked down the source to a Life Cycle Assessment study performed by a third-party sustainability science firm at one of the Savory Hubs, White Oak Pastures. This presentation goes into the study much more <a href = "https://blog.whiteoakpastures.com/hubfs/WOP-LCA-Quantis-2019.pdf">WOP-LCA-Quantis-2019.pdf</a>. <br><br>
I like the simplicity of the visualization. I think the black dots are meant to represent carbon being emitted on the left versus sequestered in the soil on the right. I like that visually but don't know whether the number or size of the black dots have anything to do with the data. I find the visualization striking and meaningful. Perhaps they could have found better photographs to illustrate the contrast between conventional and regenerative farming. I think there is some information missing. Like the numbers represent pounds of CO2 emissions per pound of meat or that the numbers are based on net total emissions for production.
