Every Mental Disorder Diagnosis in the DSM-5

I found this diagram of mental diagnoses from the DSM-5 on /r/dataisbeautiful. Despite the large number of topics characteristic of the DSM, this visualization does a great job of making the taxonomy clean and easy to navigate.

I like how the 22 primary categories each correspond to a unique color around the color wheel. Each branch of said category inherits the same color. This is both visually pleasing and makes it easy to tell which diagnoses are related. There are also a few details which help with identifying which diagnoses are connected. White connecting lines are as thick as the borders around each of those main categories. The colors aren't super bright which makes the connecting lines stand out more. The brown background compliments these colors as well, and matches the colors as if a black backdrop was brightened to the same degree that the main colors have been dimmed. The connecting lines all meet at the centers of the sides of diagnosis borders, and the graph makes good use of T and + intersections. 

At the top of the graphic, the sub-topics under "Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders" branch off to the right as opposed to just going upwards. Since text is most readable going from left to right, this helps make an efficient use of space. Not to mention, this means these list items are symmetric with the topics coming from "Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders." There is also symmetry in the left and right side subcategories, not to mention smaller details such as the single diagnoses at the top left and top right pointed out in opposite alignment. The size of the square borders for the primary categories are all the same size and proportion, which is as big as needed for the longest diagnostic category at the bottom. The secondary categories also all share the same size and proportion.

Throughout the entire graphic, the sub-lists are left-aligned and right-aligned sensibly, and different branches are aligned along the same columns. The sub-lists are also organized alphabetically. I think the right-angled-ness is also reflected in the font choice. For instance, the letter "I" is a rectangle, and "D" has two right angles.

The title is very clearly separate from the rest of the diagnoses as it uses a cutout as an inverted style.
