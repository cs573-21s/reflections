The paper "'Missing/Unspecified': Demographic Data Visualization During the COVID-19 Pandemic" by Rachel Atherton (2021 Journal of Business and Technical Education) looks at tables and graphs from the CDC that talk about race and other demographic information in relation to COVID-19. When the data is broken down by race, it is evident that Black people are significantly more affected by COVID than other groups. However, about 78% of respondents in some cases list their race as "Missing/Unspecified." This presents an issue when the visualizations are presented to the public because the missing data could show a different story. The CDC has had a tool that allowed people to investigate COVID cases by race, ethnicity, and age, which also showed the missing race data. This tool was a plain table. However, it has since been replaced by simpler bar graphs that show the basic information about race, but do not very clearly show more detailed reports or information about the missing data. There are tradeoffs between these different ways of reporting the data. The CDC's Racial Data Tracker is currently under development (at the time of this paper), so it currently looks more like a spreadsheet with some features that allow users to make queries than a visualization. However, it does the best job out of all the visualizations at showing the details of the situation, such as allowing users to see racial data in specific regions in the USA or for specific ages, and differentiating between deaths, hospitalizations, and cases. 

The bar graph visualizations are intended to explain the data and make it easier for viewers to understand. The bar graphs are easier to look at and quickly get an idea of how race relates to COVID cases. However, the visualizations that show more details in a table format show more details. They are also more truthful because it would be difficult to make an appealing bar chart that has a bar with 78% of cases missing/unspecified, but in a table this information is easier to include. he author of this paper recommends to find a balance between the simplicity and ease of the bar charts, with the important context provided in the tables that cannot be captured by a bar chart. The author also says that the flaw with nearly 80% of racial data being missing/unspecified is a flaw in the collection of the data and low prioritization of considering marginalized communities. The author acknowledges that any visualization, as well as any dataset, cannot be unbiased, so it is important to consciously consider the context and the marginalized communities when creating visualizations. 

This paper makes many important points that are relevant in all data visualization, not just COVID or health related vis. It is important for data visualizations to be easy to look at and interpret, especially when they are intended for a very wide audience, like the racial data that is relevant to all of America. It is also important to deal with missing/unspecified data with integrity. 

The CDC's new COVID Data Tracker for demographics (CDC, 2021) does a good job because it uses a simple bar chart, which is appropriate for the race data that is categorical in the surveys where people can specify their race. It also specifies clearly what percentage of the cases and deaths have reported the race and sex. It uses different colors consistently (red for cases, blue for deaths) and has several different bar charts in the demographic data section: cases by race, deaths by race, cases by sex, and deaths by sex. These visualizations are very clear and easy to read. However, the leave out some of the other context that users might wonder about, such as whether these numbers vary by region within the US, how these numbers relate to age, and or how the data looks when you are considering race and sex at the same time rather than in separate bar charts. 

The general (non-demographic) data about COVID in the CDC's Data Tracker uses color coded maps to show the cases and deaths by region. In addition to the other visualizations and data, it would be helpful if the CDC provided some maps to go along with the demographic data so that there can be more context for all the data, but in a format that is easier to look at and understand than the basic tables.
