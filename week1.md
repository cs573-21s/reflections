This visualization shows the US 2020 presidential election map, based on what each county voted for (using red to represent Republican and blue to represent Democrat). Although it has no key or text labels, a viewer can understand what is going on because it uses common knowledge about politics in the US. It then scales each county into a circle based on its number of counted votes. Thus, the size is based on population size instead of geographic area. Additionally, each circle is in the relative location on the map of the county it represents, so a viewer can understand generally where the circle is meant to represent, even without written labels.

I really like this graphic because standard election maps can be misleading when trying to understand the opinions of the general US population. With this visualization, the relative sizes of the circles are much better representation of how many people in total voted for each side, and it also shows which locations in the US have higher populations. This allows you to make other observations, such as the fact that big cities tend to vote blue. Despite the simplicity of the visual, it reveals a large amount of information about the 2020 presidential election results.

This simulation is also interesting to me because it uses d3, and thus demonstrates the capabilities of the library we are using in this course.
