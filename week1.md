The viz I chose to reflect on this week is *"The Inside Scoop of Ben & Jerry's: A look at the 98 ice cream flavors available around the world"* by Hesham Eissa and Lindsey Poulter.

Rather than creating just a static infographic, Eissa and Poulter decided to make an interactive website using d3. I think that this also made it easier to navigate or process the information in their site since your eye isn't drawn to a million things at once like it would be when viewing an infographic. By revealing different segments of their thought process and/or what a specific part of their end viz means at a time, they slowly feed the viewer more and more information, but at a rate the viewer can choose for themself. 

With this format, Eissa and Poulter weren't restricted by the amount of space they could fill in the viz, making it easier to explain parts of their viz more clearly and effectively. The way they have different snapshots makes the website seem like a collection of vizzes rather than a final product + the explanation for it. 

I've seen a similar viz format before, on the website for [Data Sketches](https://www.datasketch.es/), which I found a while ago and absolutely fell in love with. The idea behind this project is very similar to the one behind [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject) in that two information designers decide on a theme and individually create a visualization based on that theme. However, instead of weekly postcards, Shirley Wu and Nadieh Bremer did monthly visualizations. While working on their vizzes, Bremer and Wu would also document their inspiration, brain dumps, discoveries, lessons learned, etc. on a blog post. On each blog post, they would then leave a link to the final visualization. My first exposure to d3 was through their site, and interestingly enough, Eissa and Poulter cite Bremer as one of their great inspirations for their ice cream project!

Though both *The Inside Scoop of Ben & Jerry's* and *Data Sketches* shared the behind-the-scenes work the designers did, Eissa and Poulter's format reads more like a jupyter notebook rather than a side blog post like Bremer and Wu did. I think that that method of sharing and visualizing information was very groovy!
